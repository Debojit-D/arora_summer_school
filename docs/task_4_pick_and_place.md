# üõ†Ô∏è Pick and Place Task ‚Äî Student Documentation

## üìÑ Overview

This task involves implementing a **Pick-and-Place pipeline** for the **HEAL robotic arm** using:

* **Cartesian pose tracking** via **inverse kinematics**
* **Joint velocity-based trajectory execution**
* **Gripper commands** for pick and release using ROS topics

You will complete a partially filled Python script (`pick_and_place_student_template.py`) that takes the robot through a set of poses, performs grasping and releasing, and returns to the home pose.

## üéØ Objectives

By the end of this task, you should be able to:

‚úÖ Define a series of Cartesian poses in 3D space
‚úÖ Solve inverse kinematics using KDL
‚úÖ Generate joint velocity trajectories using quintic interpolation
‚úÖ Trigger grasp and release actions with ROS messages
‚úÖ Execute a full pick-and-place routine

---

## üß† Background Concepts

### 1. **Inverse Kinematics (IK)**

The robot must compute joint angles that achieve a desired end-effector pose (position + orientation).
This is done using **PyKDL** with the `ChainIkSolverPos_LMA` solver.

### 2. **Joint Velocity Control**

Instead of commanding joint positions directly, this task uses **joint velocities**, which are generated from a trajectory interpolator (quintic).

### 3. **Action Interfaces**

The robot accepts:

* `/robotA/grasp_action/goal` ‚Üí to **close** the gripper
* `/robotA/release_action/goal` ‚Üí to **open** the gripper

These are used at the appropriate points in the trajectory.

## üìÅ File Location

Your code lives at:

```bash
arora_summer_school/challenges/pick_and_place_student_template.py
```

You can run it after building the workspace using:

```bash
rosrun your_package pick_and_place_student_template.py
```

## üß© Sections to Complete

### ‚úèÔ∏è 1. Define Target Poses

Inside the constructor of the `VelocityCommander` class, you will find this block:

```python
self.poses = [
    # TODO: Fill this with the required pick and place poses.
]
```

Each entry in this list is a dictionary like:

```python
{
    'pos': kdl.Vector(x, y, z),
    'quat': kdl.Rotation.Quaternion(qx, qy, qz, qw),
    'action': 'open' or 'close' or ''
}
```

You need to define **at least 6‚Äì7 poses**:

| # | Pose Description            | Action  |
| - | --------------------------- | ------- |
| 1 | Home pose (above object)    | "open"  |
| 2 | Move down to grasp object   | ""      |
| 3 | Close gripper (pick object) | "close" |
| 4 | Lift up after grasp         | ""      |
| 5 | Move to placement position  | ""      |
| 6 | Lower and release           | "open"  |
| 7 | Return to home              | ""      |

Use real Cartesian coordinates that your robot can reach. Orientation should generally point the gripper down toward the object.

---

### ‚úèÔ∏è 2. Test Gripper Actions

The following utility functions are provided:

```python
publish_grasp_action_goal(force=100)     # Close gripper
publish_release_action_goal()            # Open gripper
```

These are automatically called based on the `action` field you define in the pose dictionary.

---

### ‚úèÔ∏è 3. Trajectory Execution

The script uses your current joint state to compute a quintic velocity trajectory to the IK-computed target. This is done using:

```python
TrajectoryPlanner.quintic_joint_trajectory(...)
```

You don't need to edit this ‚Äî just make sure your poses are valid, and the joint state topic is working.

---

## üß™ How to Test

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites:

* Robot URDF loaded into parameter server (`robot_description`)
* `/joint_states` is being published
* Velocity controller is active (`/velocity_controller/command`)
* Gripper topics `/robotA/grasp_action/goal` and `/robotA/release_action/goal` are available

### üöÄ Run the script:

```bash
rosrun your_package pick_and_place_student_template.py
```

You should see:

* The robot moving through each of your poses
* Logs confirming velocity publishing
* Gripper actions being executed at the right times

## üß∞ Troubleshooting

| Problem                       | Cause                  | Fix                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `robot_description` not found | URDF not loaded        | Use `roslaunch` to load the URDF                         |
| IK solver fails               | Pose unreachable       | Check the coordinates and ensure the robot can reach it  |
| Gripper not responding        | Topic mismatch         | Check if `/robotA/grasp_action/goal` is being published  |
| Robot not moving              | No velocity controller | Make sure the controller is running in your control loop |
